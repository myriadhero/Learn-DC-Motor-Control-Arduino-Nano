# Learn-DC-Motor-Control-Arduino-Nano
Brushed Chinese motor ~ 300 RPM, magnetic encoder

This is a project usign ATMEGA328P in an Arduino Nano

I use various libraries and input/output, arduino functions and AVR code.

My goal is to control two brushed DC motors with enough precision to drive in a square using the motor encoders (assuming no slip).
